# stock-news-sentiment
This is the final project for the Foundations of Financial Data Science course. 

Financial news articles can have significant impact on stock prices. In this project, I use the Reuters News Database to investigate this relation between the news articles sentiment and stock prices. While the original project was much wider in scope in terms of the number of companies and the number of years examined, the approach taken was similar. 

In this example, I calculate the correlation of MSFT news sentiment to MSFT stock returns. Sentiment scores are derived from MSFT related articles from the Reuters News database over the period 2010-2012. 

The results indicate that sentiment and returns are not correlated for MSFT.
